Gutach: Increased safety for pedestrians
They are not even 100 metres apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorfparkplatz in Gutach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights.
Two sets of lights so close to one another: intentional or just a silly error?
Yesterday, Gutacht's Mayor gave a clear answer to this question.
"At the time, the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser lights protect cyclists, as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle.
The system, which officially became operational yesterday, is of importance to the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junction.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor's practice and a bank, not to mention the traffic from the 'Grub' residential area.
"At times of high road and pedestrian traffic, an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety," said Eckert.
This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.
"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent," emphasised Arnold.
Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: "Here safety comes first, it's that simple," said Arnold.
A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions.
According to Arnold, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: "Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts".
The traffic light system itself, which cost around EUR 15,000, is the "most modern system that is currently available on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is fitted with coloured LEDs, which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights, even when the sun is low in the sky.
And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts, with the new ones consuming just eight.
There are three sets of lights per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology used by the new system: It is fitted with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights, the top radar sensor checks the traffic status.
If the street is clear, the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately, if not, there is a delay of around 15 seconds.
An additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.
"If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street, the green phase is extended, thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street," explained Arnold.
Of course, drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road.
Yesterday this was not the case: The light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing from the heart, telling of the hardships of his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village upbringing - the speechlessness, his tendency towards brute force and dulled sexuality, the confinement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Kaernten-born poet.
The Büchner prizewinner is known primarily as a writer of prose, with theatre texts something of a rarity for him.
In a collage of prose texts For his performance piece, "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze" (Summer lightning on the tip of your tongue), which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher ,creates a collage of prose texts.
The theatre producer has thus combined elements from the autobiographically inspired novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) [The Bondsman] featuring prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003) [Corpse, stalking his family].
On the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement: a crumpled sofa, on which cast members allude to copulating and masturbating - the eight-person ensemble work their way through the text material.
However, Director Fresacher seems to have little trust in the text.
The 70-minute performance glosses over the script with a host of director's additions, well-known from the repertoire of post-dramatic theatrical styles.
In particular, the actresses play a major role in the sometimes rather dubious staging.
They are manhandled, their heads held under water, tacked to the wall by their evening gowns.
Wrapped in cellophane or in girdles, they stumble on dangerously high heels across the set, either delivering monologues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage.
However, the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery.
The best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Purple to traditional folk songs.
Only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down, and we see flashes of Winkler's somewhat absurd sense of humour.
A black box in your car?
As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.
The tea party is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.
They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.
This really is a must for our nation.
"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles to the gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.
Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.
"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.
Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.
"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People are paying more directly into what they are getting.
The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.
The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is looking into one.
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It was not something people wanted.
As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.
Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.
Königsfeld: Small team gives a spirited performance
The voluntary fire service bravely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
For the training exercise, department commander, Hans Kammerer, chose the Feder premises on Burgberger Strasse.
A short-circuit was reported to have occurred there during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke, however, one was able to make an emergency call.
Two fire fighters equipped with respiratory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stairwell.
The building, a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were large quantities of wood and bales of straw stored inside.
In addition to this, there were also electrical machines for wood processing.
The first attempt to extinguish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine.
Another line was taken from the surface hydrant around 100 metres away.
Only three attempts could be made to extinguish the blaze.
A hollow-stream nozzle in the building was also used.
For Hans Kammerer, the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff.
In case of emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daytime task force.
The Commander expressed his satisfaction following the exercise.
Networking between universities and companies is important
On a visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, it was explained to Parliamentary President Guido Wolf in Titisee-Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he addressed this important question alongside the executive principals of the vocational colleges and the district grammar school and the chairs of the parents' council.
"Education is an important factor for the location," highlighted Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans Thoma School, which introduced the networked Hochschwarzwald Education Centre Schools Project.
During the presentation, Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project.
Since 2011, there has been successful collaboration in Wälderstadt between the Support Centre, the District Grammar School and the Vocational School Complex.
He also praised the family-friendly approach within the district.
"It is important, not only to keep the family life stage in mind, but, on account of demographic change, the period spent providing long-term care and support for relatives as well," explained Wolf.
He also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of relatives.
"Without support from their employer, the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract," said Wolf.
However, nobody can afford to lose qualified workers," he added.
Another, particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies.
"After all, people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region, along with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the State Parliamentary President, expressing his thorough conviction.
For it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered.
In his opinion, the district's advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south-west Germany, in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition to this, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced first-hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport.
"You must continue to be tenacious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better," he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance.
Music makes for an entertaining afternoon
It was 15 years ago that the Kaul family first invited the Dietingen senior citizens for coffee and cake, followed by a snack.
Previously, the elderly citizens were hosted in the service station canteen.
The coffee afternoon is now held in the St. Josef nursing home.
The residents of the home were delighted with the delicious cakes and tarts.
Later on, a sausage salad was provided.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained those in attendance with popular tunes.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, serving as the foremost boundary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kirchstrasse, will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig Autumn Folk Festival, when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard, a small corner wall with balustrades was installed to stabilise and relieve the static load on the old natural stone wall, which is more than one hundred years old.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen Municipal Planning and Building Control Authority, the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Memorial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals, which will then be submitted to the Town Council, which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure.
A decision is expected to be made in the coming year.
Following the renovation, plastering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard, within the two wings of the 1912 school, as a subsequent measure the boundary wall, which is in need of refurbishment, must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall between the old school-yard and Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation, primarily as a result of water and frost damage, on account of the lack of drainage, and is leaning forwards.
Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.
A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils, and this is the purpose of the current fortification work.
The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008/2009, however, high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back.
The Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming.
If this authority were to impose requirements, then the town of Bräunlingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlingen Primary School, who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building, with a new hall, will soon be able to use the old school yard as well.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Green Party, has now engaged in the ongoing discussions regarding the future of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Music Academy.
"I do not think it is right to abandon comprehensive training in the Stuttgart Music College," said Özdemir, speaking to the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
As such, Özdemir, who is the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September, is in disagreement with the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this government is urging the reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
In accordance with these plans, the jazz and pop courses, among others, are to be relocated from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College.
US borders: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" intended for drug smuggling.
As announced by the US Customs Authorities, the pipe between Tijuana and San Diego, measuring more than 500 metres in length, was equipped with electricity, a railway track and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery, with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the details provided, the tunnel had not yet been put into use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar," said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California, Laura Diffy, at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Referring to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money".
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico.
Built by experts
Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel, investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year.
The railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered carts could be used on it.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section measuring 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres across.
It would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA.
Two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was detained due to the seizure of the marijuana.
All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, according to the authorities.
Since 2006, eight tunnels of this type have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
However, this was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Squad in San Diego.
They will do anything to make it to the USA.
No specific details were given regarding those detained, but it is reported that at least one is Mexican
They can expect prison terms of up to ten years.
2014 is to be a year of celebration in Geisingen
The anniversary celebrations in the town of Geisingen, to mark the 1,250th
anniversary of the first documented mention of the town, are drawing closer.
When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will be upon us.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in the year 794.
A deed was drafted in Kirchen, in which both towns are mentioned.
On 15 March, the anniversary year will be officially launched, and because Geisingen currently has no suitable venues, this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary celebrations, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1,250th anniversary with a celebratory weekend from 18 to 20
July.
On the Friday there will be a ceremony, and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kirchtalhalle.
The Kirchen-Hausen Kirchenfest festival will also be held on this celebratory weekend.
Town Musical Director, Rudolf Barth, has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June, in conjunction with the Schwarzwaldverein [Black Forest Association] Mid-Summer Festival, on 12 July in the Arena, accompanied by fireworks, and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadtmusik (Town Musical Society) in the new Festival Hall.
This venue will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, with the official date set for the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisingen town anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
"However, it will not merely be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but rather a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which now consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed.
The new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen.
However, 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries in other respects.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki (Strohglonki Fool's Guild celebration) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary/ The Harmonie Gutmadingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celebratory banquet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celebrating the Bezirksfest [District Music Festival].
The Leipferdingen Nursing Home will turn 40 years old, the Geisingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May, and the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brunnenfest [Fountain Festival] from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764, in a deed of donation, which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery.
The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse.
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed.
One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,250-year anniversary in this way, is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform (Gemeindereform).
Council sets its sights on rail system
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost, in order to increase traffic safety?
The Town Councils have decided that the answer is yes.
Schiltach will have to contribute up to EUR 220,000 to the project.
The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they will be required to contribute one third of the costs, with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government.
Schiltach's town master mason, Roland Grießhaber, explained the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing to the Town Council.
At the crossing, the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line.
Larger vehicles, for example those that transport long logs, would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic, without having to block the railway line.
Grießhaber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic.
This was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council, as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road: Thomas Kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement: "Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.
Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.
Given that it is likely that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councillors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was consented to by a majority, on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could, if required, extend the connecting road in the "Bahnhofstraße" direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn's reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck.
The town, as the authority responsible for road construction, would then bear responsibility for this.
The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes.
Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are, the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to, argued Haas.
At this point, the risk of a train collision with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway crossings, on account of the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight, directly alongside the stopping point.
The trains themselves, coming from the central station, must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision.
According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would "bear the brunt of the cost" for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the reconstruction of the "Vor Heubach" and 'Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn, to be unproblematic.
ESA makes decision on major space missions: Missions costing billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five of which are still in the running.
Distant worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.
Whether or not life exists on at least some of these, no-one knows.
The choice is a difficult one: Should we search for gravitational waves?
Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for planets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency, ESA.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.
The budget for "L-Missions" such as this lies at around one billion Euro.
The projects are planned to start in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short list.
Numerous panels are assessing the proposals, posing questions to the researchers.
Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four main questions were chosen by the ESA, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, are to find the answers.
What are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life?
The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness.
A large infra-red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life exist there?
In order to pursue this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail.
The possibilities are, however, limited - Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres, and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life.
The magnetic activity of a star, the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an important role.
It is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system, to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved an M-class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro) to address this matter.
The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L-Missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme will address this subject.
The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is planned to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?
Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
Alongside the materials familiar to us, from which stars, planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed, there exists dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe.
Thus far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, planned to commence in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy.
Proposals that are in the running...
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L-mission, in the opinion of many experts, is "E-Lisa", a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravitational waves.
Many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To date they have never been proved to exist.
The scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could achieve this.
The mission involves placing a detector, consisting of two or three probes, in outer space.
Unlike systems on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang, and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission place: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which among other things would research black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth.
Among others, proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars, conducting research on the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as proposals in the area of solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.
However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.
O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.
That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.
It will still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.
In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.
Sayings come from the Bible
At least 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of the year, in the Evangelical Parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Sayings from the Bible" and "Expressions from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the Chairperson of the Parish Council, agreed to give a talk on Biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain pearls of wisdom, commandments or warnings," she explained.
She compared several German sayings with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.
She referred to sayings such as: "Holzauge sei wachsam" (keep your eyes peeled), "wie Schuppen von den Augen fallen" (like scales falling from one's eyes), "ein Auge auf jemand werfen" (to cast an eye on someone), "den Seinen gibt's der Herr im Schlaf" (good things come to some when they sleep) and "seine Hände in Unschuld waschen" (to wash one's hands of something).
On several occasions, the speaker asked those listening to guess what proverb they were based on.
Expressions from the Middle Ages were addressed by Parish Councillor Christel Dehner: "Aller guten Dinge sind drei" (All good things come in threes), "blau machen" (to skip school/work), "etwas verhauen" (to wallop something).
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions, which she referred to as "bridges to the past".
To round off the morning there was a tombola.
The prizes were placed, covered, on a table and were humorously paraphrased prior to being presented to the winners.
Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger was also to be found among the visitors to the joint breakfast.
Learning rather than unemployment: Tourism pilot project for the untrained
A pilot project for the tourist industry is being launched today in the Mecklenburg lake district.
Under the management of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as untrained workers, will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three winters.
"What's innovative about it is that the six-month courses end with diplomas," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
There are many benefits: The participants will not be unemployed, the companies receive trained skilled workers, which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants, and the agency will not have to fund unemployment.
Also involved in the project are the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststätte, Dehoga) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The issue will be resolved this evening.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.
Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.
Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
In October, the number of jobless fell slightly by 22, to a total of 1,307.
The rate of 3.1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in September, "however, we had hoped for more," said Monika Felder-Bauer, acting branch manager of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Several companies have thus far reacted cautiously when it comes to hiring.
Stating a reason for this, Felder-Bauer said: "We have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled crafts and trades, healthcare and geriatric care."
Seasonal job offers for staff in hotel and restaurant businesses have been coming in since September.
The Winter season within the industry begins in mid-December.
The complete background report on this can be found in the "Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt" newspaper dated 31/10/2013 (page 33).
Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.
After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.
"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.
But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.
There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.
Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.
That will happen all through the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.
Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.
The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.
Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles Airport
On Friday morning (local time) an unknown suspect fired shots at the LAX Airport.
While the airport management announced via short messaging service Twitter that the shooter is in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man is dead.
A member of security staff was also killed.
The media also reported that several people injured.
US President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation, said White House spokesperson Jay Carney.
The incident took place in Terminal 3. Eye witnesses reported seeing a shooter with a gun in one of the departure lounges, as was reported by several media.
One traveller told the broadcaster CNN about how many people had sought protection in panic.
Travellers screamed and children cried.
Panic broke out among those waiting, with many hiding behind seats in fear.
An employee of the "Los Angeles Times" who was travelling at the time told of how he had heard two shots fired.
An employee of security company TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like something out of a movie".
The man reported that he was then himself taken to a safety area.
The shots were said to have been fired near a security inspection area.
Airport building evacuated
Television footage revealed how numerous ambulances and police cars arrived at a terminal.
One hundred people were brought out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter published photos of a SWAT officer and a weapon lying on the ground.
According to a message shared by the airport management via twitter, the incident began at 9.30 am (local time).
The access roads were blocked off, which, according to CNN, caused long tailbacks.
Except for the landing of arrival aircraft, flight traffic was temporarily suspended, it was reported.
However, several planes could be seen taking off on CNN.
Terminal 3 serves mainly small US airlines.
The Los Angeles LAX airport is one of the largest airports in the USA.
Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.
The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.
He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.
On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.
Revolutionary Sacred Music Factory
To close the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen (Dunningen Amateur Choir, or Glee Club, if you like) will perform Franz Schubert's "Deutsche Messe" (German Mass) to accompany two church services.
Following the great success of the musical, "Rock my Life", which enthused audiences this past Spring, the Liederkranz will bless two church services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe, to close its anniversary year celebrations.
On Saturday 26 October, this exceptional mass will be heard from 7.00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Marinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October, from 10.15, at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called 'German Mass', with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe" (Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass), D 872, is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert, dating from 1826, at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary.
Patron Johan Philipp Neumann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services.
Under the directorship of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the wind ensemble of the Frohsinn Tennenbronn Music Society, and by Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism visibly gives way to confidence
The 2015 Parish Council elections will bring about fundamental change, for example in the Haslach Pastoral Care Unit (Seelsorgeeinheit Haslach, SE).
There will then only be one joint Parish Council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
This is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the Parish Councils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible.
During the course of the day one thing became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new system is reluctantly yet visibly giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-time members of the pastoral care team addressed topics ranging from perceptions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms, to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Parish Council.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drawn-up guidelines for pastoral care units in the arch-diocese of Freiburg with the help of  a presentation.
According to the guidelines, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will be a corporation under public law, which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.
There will then only be one joint Parish Council and a Foundation Council, in which the rector will be represented by virtue of his office.
From each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, with so-called church community teams set up on-site in the six parishes.
In future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis.
Regarding the issue of the finances of the individual parishes, the need for extensive discussion became evident.
The reforms plan for the accumulated assets in the parishes to be retained for a specified purpose.
Accounts payable, on the other hand, will be passed over to the "church community" as a whole.
In particular, planned major investments, the debts from which thus affect all parishes, were cause for great concern.
"In the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes by themselves," said Haslach's Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Barbar Ritter, Chair of the Committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, has practical experience of a joint committee for five parishes.
In 2006 she set herself the task, "Become one, remain five" and came to realise that the task is really not that simple.
The Committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Parish Council, and the practical work of the church community teams.
The specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.
At the end, Parish Counsellor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was agreed on by a clear majority.
Electricity to become more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf will have to adjust to high electricity costs.
As Managing Director of the municipal energy company, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, families of four in Pfullendorf will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year.
One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEC Levy from 5.277 to 6.3 Cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy will be reset by the four operators of the large power grids, in October of each year.
They estimate the additional costs they will incur as a result of the "energy turnaround", which they will be able to recover by means of a levy on the price of electricity.
The Pfullendorf municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain.
In its projections, the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a levy higher than that reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
The specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy cmpany can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week.
"We are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents.
Traffic lights permanently red: observe waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green.
The contact loop on the road does not react, or the light itself is defective.
What should you do - drive through on red?
If an affected person has waited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light, and provided the crossing is clear, they can drive on, explained Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in "Motorrad" (Motorcycle) magazine.
The waiting time must, however, be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-to-case basis.
Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed.
Anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must, however, be aware that he/she will be fully liable for any resulting accident.
Anyone who waits for less than five minutes has, under certain circumstances, not waited long enough, warned Becker, referring to a ruling of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the case in question, a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for negligently jumping a red light.
The traffic lights were actually not defective, but rather turned green just a few minutes later.
He was spared a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not spared a fine.
Town Council delighted with solid budget
Every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has good reason to smile.
The municipality coffers in Herdwangen-Schönach are well stocked and the administration has been debt-free since 2005.
In this sense, this the 2012 budgetary year, can also be recorded as a complete success.
This became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned, at around 7.6 million Euro.
The administrative budget surplus, at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections.
The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities' contribution towards income tax.
The capital budget also stood well above the projected values.
Instead of the projected EUR 1.5 million Euro, the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million.
"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned, the reserves also came in higher.
In total, they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million, to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work.
"A job like this is not something you achieve overnight," said Gerster in praise of the annual financial statement.
He and the Town Councillors are clearly delighted with the good figures.
It may sound like a paradox, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens.
In the past, a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates.
However, according to Gerster, from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state.
There are prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements.
Among other requirements, the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must levy certain municipal rates.
"We have to address the subject of municipal rates, as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies," commented Gerster regarding this matter.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter - a choir member for 60 years
Having been a singer for 60 years, Hubert Wermter's story with the Cäcilia Male Choral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was ceremonially honoured.
As per usual, Hubert Wermter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice choir.
Even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir, which has achieved much more than popularity during this period.
Wermter has also been active within the association, serving as a member of the committee for 28 years, among other roles.
For his commitment and loyalty to the organisation, he has also received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Lay Pastor acting on behalf of the Cäcilian Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with an Association Certificate and a letter of commendation signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst - the choir also serves as a church choir.
His choir colleagues presented him with a German Choral Association certificate and an engraved pewter plate.
Aside from honouring Hugo, the 31st Autumn Festival progressed as usual: Alongside the Betra Male Voice Choir, the Salzstetten Choral Club, the Baisingen Choral Division and the Local Music Society, the Vollmaringen singers delivered a colourful blend of different choral and song styles, which entertained the 400 or so visitors.
The Vollmaringen Male Voice Choir got things running with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The Betra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
With its mixed choir and its ladies' ensemble - the "Impulschor" (Impulse Choir), the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival.
The mixed choir carried listeners away to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folksongs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulschor" also drew on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were included on their programme.
The Choral Division of the Baisingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", while the Vollmaringen Music Society provided the crowning musical conclusion.
For children, there was a small auxiliary programme - "Oma Hanne" (Grandma Hanne), a.k.a Hannelore Stollsteimer, performed a 'Kasperl' theater (similar to Punch and Judy) and read some stories, which kept the children entertained throughout the afternoon.
Children's dreams come true
Over the next few days, the nursery schools and day care centres in Zollernalb district will be receiving mail.
The Schwarzwälder Bote (Black Forest Herald), in collaboration with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb Savings Bank, would like to support the institutions in granting their construction and renovation wishes.
Does the nursery school need a new sand box?
All nurseries, day care centres and créches from across the entire Zollernalb district can become involved in the campaign.
If they have a construction or renovation request for their institution, they can register this with the Schwarzwälder Bote.
Get creative with your children and surprise the judging panel of the Kindergarten-Baustelle (Nursery School-Construction Site) campaign.
A panel consisting of representatives from the Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb will select three wishes from those submitted.
What are the requirements for participation?
It must be possible to fulfil the wish using construction materials to a maximum value of EUR 2,000 and on one (campaign) day.
Furthermore, the winner must provide a number of hard-working building helpers.
What is the deal with the campaign day and the helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus will be providing the materials.
They will be delivered to the nursery schools on an agreed day and should there be assembled/made use of directly by the helpers.
Helpers can include parents, grandparents, friends, organisations and, of course, the teachers and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."
The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
The official inaugural ceremony for the astro-turf sports field did not wane in significance for the town and the football club, in spite of the cold weather and rain.
Everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony last Saturday, however the weather gods chose not to cooperate.
So anyone who came without an umbrella, or for whatever reason could not hold onto one, drew the short straw.
This was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony, as well as for a number of speakers.
Thus, FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream, also got fairly wet.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project, the Town Council, the companies involved and club members who played a part.
Particular mention went out to Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The spry pensioners laid 400 square metres of flagging for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Member of the State Parliament, Karl Rombach.
Further words of greeting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner, Hubert Baier, the District Chairperson of the Southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth division.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that weather-related influences in the Spring and Autumn had repeatedly afflicted the original sports field, to such an extent that it could not be played on.
It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered, when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Salinensee Lake were considered.
Both ideas were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts turned to laying an astro-turf pitch, which was generally viewed as the perfect solution.
Specific plans were drawn up two years ago, when the FC inherited the Schabelstube in leasehold, promised a contribution of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 104,000.
In October 2012, the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 356,000 of the total cost of EUR 560,000, summarised Klumpp.
Work began on the 68 x 108 metre astro-turf pitch on 4 June.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, of which half was used for the laying of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations, addressing the topics of internal affairs and justice.
To this end, the competent working group met this morning.
Among other issues, topics discussed included direct democracy, the bribery of MPs and the Federal Police.
During the morning, the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discussions.
Among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nationality, in which regard both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD would like to put an end to the pressure placed on immigrant children to decide on one nationality - the Union rejects the notion of a dual passport.
Regarding the subject of traffic, which was not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD substantiated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CSU.
A toll road sticker would amount to a "flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for issues relating to traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
There would be a threat of diverted traffic on country roads, which are already accident hotspots.
The introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step, in Pronold's eyes.
"There is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be abolished at a later point in time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The "singing mountain wave" on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was actually not the question on people's lips at the Killesberg Open-Air Theatre on Friday evening.
It genuinely was a tropical evening in Stuttgart.
This therefore provided the ideal conditions for pop star, Dieter Thomas Kuhn, and his band.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to information from the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was travelling in his car on the Kempener bypass in the direction of Grefrath, at around 9.15 p.m..
As he went to turn right onto St. Töniser Straße he failed to see the 37-year-old's oncoming vehicle.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachen resident suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Road block following accident on the Schänzle roundabout
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was travelling out of town in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustrasse.
Shortly before the Schänzle roundabout he noticed that was in the left-turn lane going in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved across to the right lane.
In so doing, he collided with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanz resident, travelling in that lane.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driver travelling behind the BMW was also damaged.
In total, EUR 15,000 of material damage was caused, announced the police.
The road had to be blocked off while the accident was being investigated, the statement continued.
Vienna Airport abolishes passenger call-outs
Mr. Max Maier, please make your way to Gate 24.
In future, announcements such as this will no longer happen at Vienna International Airport.
The majority of loudspeaker announcements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level.
The goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere.
As airport spokesperson Peter Kleeman announced to Radio Vienna that in adjusting the approach towards announcements, Vienna Airport is following an international trend.
Among others, the airports in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call-outs.
By doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call-outs come through the loudspeakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be calmer in future.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of, and at the same time, all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them," said Kleeman while chatting to the radio broadcaster.
Highland Games in Kaltenhof
Alongside brake van pulling with tractors,  there will also be a second contest at the agricultural autumn festival at Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday 7 September, the Highland Games will start at 1:30 p.m.
While they are of course a Scottish tradition, they have been given a touch of Swabian colour at the Kaltenhof event grounds.
Teams and individual competitors will be pitted against one another in the disciplines of tossing the caber, horseshoe tossing and bucket carrying.
The caber is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilometres.
"It isn't about the distance," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The log must be thrown vertically, somersault once and then finish lying straight.
This scores maximum points.
In tossing the horseshoe, it all comes down to accuracy.
Horseshoes are thrown onto a peg from a distance of eight metres.
Participants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bucket of water 50 metres.
Time is recorded and water quantity measured in a vat at the end.
Two members of each "clan" or team can then take part in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual contests receive prizes.
Teams can practice from 10:00 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desirable - for example competitors can wear kilts.
However, Swabian traditional clothing is also permitted.
The judging panel will also award a few bonus points for "outfits".
Registration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highland Games and the tractor pulling contest, which will begin half an hour beforehand, there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, fans of brass band music will be in for a treat of their own.
At 19:00, the "biraböhmische" (a play on words alluding to the regions pear trees, Bohemia, and perhaps their love of beer as well!) wind music group from Schömberg, provide a great evening of entertainment.
The band plays lively polkas and marches.
However, their repertoire also includes emotive waltzes and a full big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen will also be there, better known as the 'singing inn keeper and black sausage baron".
In the past, he has appeared at the Christmas market in Dornhan and the Narrenzunft (Fool's Guild event).
On Sunday, the Leinstetten Music Society will entertain audiences with a morning session, with the Böffingen Farmer's Band as guests from 2:00 p.m., and then the "Oldies" will bring the celebrations to a close.
The celebrations will get under way on Friday, with the "Stoppelacker" (Stubble Field) party featuring DJ Ralf.
Other items in the itinerary on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tractor meet and exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Further attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the craft market and sheep shearing.
Specially for children, there is a petting zoo, "straw bouncy castle", tractor driving (under supervision) and tractor surfing.
The event is organised by the community hall association, the ski club and the "Zündkapsele" (blasting caps) tractor enthusiasts.
An overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition promotes vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Mashed tofu with plant cream, for example, serves as a substitute for quark cheese.
The Vegetarian Association will provide further examples on World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Association of Germany will propose a host of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, while yoghurt can be replaced by soya yoghurt.
Soya, oat, almond or rice milk can be used in place of milk.
Plant whipping cream can replace traditional whipping cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake.
50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
A dough becomes fluffy by replacing egg with a mixture of one tablespoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of cornflour and three tablespoons of mineral water, for example.
50 grams of soya yoghurt or silken tofu can also fulfil this purpose.
According to information from the Vegetarian Association, around 800,000 Germans currently have a vegan diet, i.e. a 100% vegetable diet.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the pupils of the Schwarzwald Grammar School got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, they headed straight for Brooklyn Bridge, via which the heart of the city, Manhattan, can be reached on foot.
From here there is a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly impressive in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours, however, true to the slogan, "the city never sleeps", the day was rounded off with a trip to Times Square.
In spite of a shutdown, they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day, and climb the statue on foot.
They then moved on to the Financial District, via Wall Street, to visit the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building, enjoying the views from a height of 373 metres.
They then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets, via the Rockerfeller Center, to Central Park, which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun.
Following a short flight from New York to Boston, the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.
Once again this year, on Saint Hubert's day, a Hubert mass will be celebrated in the Parish of St. Marien on Hülsbergstrasse.
St. Hubert was, according to legend, a truly ruthless hunter, who converted following a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
Hunting horn group "Jagdreiter Westfalen", under the directorship of Brigitte Kluth, played old, traditional French melodies on parforce horns (natural horns in the key of E flat).
The wind players wear riding clothes, as they provide musical accompaniment mainly for riders, horses and packs of hounds on drag hunts.
The solemn mass is to take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag stands out with a new café.
One that invites you to linger a while and to come again.
One that wants to get its name out there.
According to dictionaries, déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon, which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in Kleve County, with a view of the Rhein-Waal University, it doesn't always have to remain a pure déjà vu feeling.
Ultimately, this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name: to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recurring basis, not just theoretically, but tangibly.
Because it is fun and simply beautiful.
A glance into the internal workings at Opschlag 8 gives the onlooker a positive feeling right from the outset.
With its ultra-modern yet cosy café ambience, it looks like a place designed to make you feel good.
The team here, with business founders, Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm, spoils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails.
In addition to this, there are delicious cakes or freshly baked baguettes, filled to order.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs prior to opening the chic café on the Opschlag: They previously managed the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.
By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the friendly café lovers hope to reach a wider audience.
Not least through university customers.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
In actual fact, here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets.
Speaking of café lovers...
The two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee.
They themselves enjoy the fragrant, hot brew in a variet of formats.
Espresso fan
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan, while Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"And a baguette with it - that's my thing," she revealed to the NRZ.
There have already been two events held in the brightly lit café.
Or perhaps more accurately, one.
This is because the Hafenfest took place more outside than in - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
However, there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
The two 33-year-olds found it "beautiful, successful and funny".
But it was not for everyone.
Perhaps this is why Daniel Büttner is not a vocal fan of evening events: "You just cannot please everyone".
And with an event, I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event.
For this reason, events will always be an exception to the rule for us.
"We want to cause as little disruption as possible to normal business".
That is to say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
This is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is fast becoming a 'restaurant mile'.
This is to the delight of many Kleve residents, guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the 'restaurant mile', and with it the Café Déjà Vu, for themselves.

A day of thanks with the MGV (Male Choral Society) in Dinker
This year the "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" MGV issued an invitation to its 165th anniversary celebration, which 52 guests, active singers and their wives were happy to accept.
In the clubhouse at the "Witteborg" Inn in Dinker, all those present enjoyed the friendly get-together in the name of music.
Traditionally, the anniversary celebration is also always the fitting occasion to bestow honours.
This time around, secretary Rolf Wagener was delighted to receive the special "Singer of the Year" award.
"Not only have you kept countless records for us, but you have also done so much running around for us, and for this we offer our sincere thanks," said Choir Chairman Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of the presentation of "activity posies", this year went to Choir Director Dieter Schulze, with 44 attendance marks, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler, each having attended 42 times.
Fifth place went to Artur Brückner, responsible for organising music copies.
The Board of Directors gave special thanks to the team managed by innkeeper, Ange Pier-Ribbert, which once again delighted those present with a top class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations.
The "Friedrich-Wilhelm" MGV meets for its regular choir rehearsals in the clubhouse every Tuesday at 19:45.
"New voices that love to sing are more than welcome any time," said Schlotmann.
UN hails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has gone four match days without victory, a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight handball team.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon will not let there be any doubt of this fact.
Everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand.
That said, I do hope that we finally start winning again.
"I no longer remember how a victory like that tastes," said Malmon, anticipating success for his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-tier reserves from Fredenbeck are no't exactly in the best form at the moment, Malmon has issued a warning in advance
I trained many of the players myself in the A-Youth.
Consequently, they will be particularly motivated playing against their former coach.
"In addition, we will have to wait and see whether reinforcements from the first team will be there," explained the SG coach.
In any case, if they are to finally get back on the winning track, Malmon's team will have to improve on recent performances.
There have been major problems, primarily in terms of covering and counter attacking.
The team's eye for the goal must be considerably improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break.
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.
Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying many of the myths would be "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he said.
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He added authors and teachers being "overtly didactic" is a "total switch-off" for children, with messages being "subliminated" in enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that must be subliminated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The old basis of showing not telling.
Hansjakob back in Freihof once again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his final years in the "Freihof" were brought to life.
The large audience was inspired by the extremely amusing role play.
From his arrival, to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death, Alois Kraftzcyk, the scriptwriter and actor portraying Hansjakob, has written an entertaining play, which received great acclaim under the directorship of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann, serving as narrator, guided the audience through the ten different scenes, explained circumstances and provided links explaining leaps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his childhood paradise, to his Freihof.
It was there that the role-play began, with Alois Krafczyk shining once again in his famous role as the town's great son.
True to style, he travelled with a two-horse carriage drawn by "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" (Black Forest Chestnut Horses) owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, but was also welcomed by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann managed unbelievably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amazingly well, in terms of both her expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected musical pieces, thus rounding off the performance.
The honour of presenting the title of honorary citizen went to Haslach's Mayor, Heinz Winkler, who, together with a section of the Town Council, made an appearance representing the Mayor of Hüttich from back in Hansjakob's day.
The "Dreikönig" singers then made their own appearance, leading Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Dreikönig group back to life".
With their song, "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the Freihof, as did the "Storchentagskinder" with their loud cries of "Heraus, Heraus" .
In his day, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the institutional church, as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy, the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war.
He found his place of rest on his native soil, behind his mausoleum on the Brand  near Hofstetten.
The role-play ended with the words "A restless spirit finally found rest and returned home forever".
The performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience.
Basketball: Hopes are growing for the Neckar Riesen (Neckar Giants).
The chances of the relegated Ludwigsburg Budesliga basketball players remaining in the league have improved.
This is because there is to be a wild card procedure, and the Neckar Riesen are now up against one applicant fewer.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project is declining to make an application for a possible stand-in place.
"We will not participate in the wild card process," said former national team player Pascal Roller, who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012.
However, there was no sigh of relief to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence," said boss of the Neckar Riesen Alexander Reil, speaking to our paper.
Newly promoted Düsseldorf Baskets have until 23 May to submit documents to the arbitration panel and prove their financial fitness for the Bundesliga.
However, the Rhineland team have already been refused the licence twice.
The Court of Arbitration is the authority of last resort.
Haigerloch: Focus on the Abendmahlskirche
As the town's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Protestant Church in Haigerloch, the town's Office of Culture and Tourism is to dedicate the last of this year's public thematic tours on Sunday 27 October to the Abendsmahlskirche (Church of the Holy Communion).
Following a visit to the Nuclear Bunker Museum, the focus will turn to Haigerloch in the period after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning glory will be a visit to the Abendmahlskirche.
There the participants of the tour will be told the story of the construction of the church and will gain insight into the development of the Protestant congregation, in what is a Catholic area through and through.
Last but not least, while in the church eyes will also turn to the last supper painting, painted by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous work Leonardo da Vinci in Milan.
The meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is the Nuclear Bunder Museum, at 3:00 p.m.
Tickets are available from the ticket office at the Nuclear Bunker Museum.
The Haigerloch Town Tourist Office is available for questions and to provide you with information.
Snowden may make further statements in Russia
The former US intelligence expert, Edward Snowden, may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal from his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation, which were not named in greater detail.
Such matters are to be clarified at an intergovernmental level, it was stated.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is virtually impossible.
"If this were to happen, he would lose his status as a refugee," said the Agency, quoting their source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden would be at risk of deportation if he were to travel there, the source continued.
Endurance pays dividends
Six teams battled to become champion at the club tennis tournament.
In the end, it was the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team that decided the final match.
The tennis division of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf (Rohrdorf Sports Fans) enjoyed perfect weather for the tournament for local clubs and enthusiasts.
The focus of the tournament was on the fun of playing tennis.
Five matches were scheduled for each team, with every team playing one match against all the others.
The matches were doubles matches with a long set up to nine points, or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter managed the tournament
The organisation of the tournament was placed in the trusty hands of Anja Schlichter, who was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three matches and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament moved into the crucial phase.
The favourites, Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams from the SG Rohrweiler), meaning that the last two games had to produce a victor.
At the awards ceremony, Carmen Müller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to Andre Maier and Matthias Bronner, who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg.
Second place was taken by the Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic partnership.
Bronze went to Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
In the late afternoon sun, accompanied by coffee and cake, the tournament drew to a successful close.
On the last weekend in August, the Vogtsbauernhof Black Forest Open Air Museum in Gutach near Hornberg will once again be firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on a Saturday and Sunday, this year on on 24 and 25 August, to a colourful party for children and families as part of the summer holiday programme, with numerous participation activities and events.
"On both days, adults and children alike can learn various traditional handicrafts," said the press release.
Whether producing soap, turning candles, felting or making silk, there is a suitable activity whatever your age.
The children will receive help from regional artisans, present from 11.00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.
Activities will also be taking place in the museum workshop.
The young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or spinning tops.
The host of old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or walking on stilts, promises plenty of fun.
Here speed and coordination are the order of the day.
For any miniature detectives, the open air museum will be offering a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at midday and 2.00 p.m. respectively.
On a tour of the premises, the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up.
In addition, visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Chestnut horses.
It is not just horses that can be found and admired on the grounds, but many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens as well.
On the Sunday the children will also be able to enjoy the clown, Otsch, who will be doing pranks with the museum guests from 11.00 a.m.
Meanwhile, a cosy and magical alternative will be provided by Hermann Büttner.
The story-teller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fairytale at 11.00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
The traditional children's dance group from Gutach will also be performing at 11:30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both event days, from 11.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m., numerous artisans such as the broom maker, the sewer, the spinner, the weaver and the baker will be letting visitors look over their shoulders.
So, visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Munro is considered a lovable oddball, all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 1920 motorbike.
In spite of his heart defect, Burt could not be deterred from pursuing his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop, he set off to Los Angeles by ship.
The film will be followed by coffee, tea and cake.
Piercing beep disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested highly in land
They stockpile the coal that arrives on ships.
At the same time, the company also has other irons in the fire at the location.
Besides coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also active in the field of wind park logistics, among other ventures.
The coals shimmer black in the storage yard in front of the embankment.
Here two huge blue stacker and reclaimer machines distribute or load the coals as required.
With each movement of the handling machines, a shrill warning noise rings out over the site.
"The signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescribed," said Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable wind, they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town.
The 40-year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in a position to make the warning signals quieter by means of the implementation of technical measures.
In future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours.
For Matthias Schrell has some further plans at the location.
With the construction of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the mooring basin to the front of the terminal, sunken to a depth of 18.5 metres, it has for some time now been possible to unload Capesize bulk carriers here.
"In terms of handling, this year we hope to break the 3 million tonne mark," said Schrell.
Alongside the local Eon power plant, the imported coals also go to power plants inland.
When the GDF-Suez plant is added to the network, around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball players optimistic in spite of first defeat.
Even their first defeat in the Euroleague could not curtail the huge optimism of the FC Bayern München Basketballers.
"No-one can stop us believing that we can win, even against the best team in Europe over the last two years," assessed Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic following the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) defeat to title defenders Olympiakos Piräus on Thursday evening.
We have delivered a message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first three appearances in the European top flight, the Munich team put in a good performance for long periods, but in the crucial phases were not sufficiently focussed.
Initially the guests managed to turn a 15-point deficit into a lead, with 13 minutes to go, before Piräus was able to turn the game around once again.
"We fought back incredibly well against the two-time Euroleague champions, but then once again made careless mistakes.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful strikers for the Munich team, who had celebrated clear wins against the Italian Series champions Montepaschi Siena, and the Polish title-holders, Zielona Góra, in their first two games.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.
This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process, one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After many years, we have now reached an agreement with the International Nuclear Energy Authorities to clear up the differences from past years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It will without doubt be a long path, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
